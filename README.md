IOG Architecture Triage Service
===================================

Overview
This service is the initial estimation of the design, cost and resource requirements of new projects entering the Infrastructure and Operations group.

Process
When a new project is being entered via IPM process, it gets routed via Jira to the IOG architecture group based on pre-defined business unit assignments. The architect studies the request and if necessary reaches out the requesting party for more information, potentially gathers details from internal IOG engineering teams and does a brief "t-shirt sizing" of the request.
