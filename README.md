# Overview
This service provides approved software distribution to managed corporate computers for LexisNexisRisk Solutions Group by the Desktop Engineering Team within Infrastructure and Operations group.

# Process
When a new project is being entered via IPM process, it gets routed via Jira to the IOG architecture group based on pre-defined business unit assignments. The architect studies the request and if necessary reaches out the requesting party for more information, potentially gathers details from internal IOG engineering teams and does a brief "t-shirt sizing" of the request.
